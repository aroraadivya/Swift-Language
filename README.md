Variables and Constants 

1. Variables and Constants are used to keep track of your data within the app.
2. Use var to declare variable and let to declare constant.
3. Use equal sign(=) to assign value to a variable or constant.
4. Use Camel Case for naming.
5. Variables and Constants names should be descriptive but not very long.
6. When you reassign data to a variable, it must be the same type as the initial Data type.
7. Value of variables can be changed, but not constant's.

Data Types

1.String-piece of text(var str:String = "Divya").
2.Int-whole numbers positive and negative(var intezer:Int = 100).
